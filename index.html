    <q>When the waves are good, nobody works.</q>
    <p>
        Being a typical <strong>Californian</strong>, I grew up in the water. There are few things more enjoyable to me
        than spending an early morning out on the waves. Surfing is a surreal experience regardless of the quality of
        the waves. The best way to describe feeling is <em>Zen</em>, I suppose. You are surrounded by all the natural
        life teeming in the ocean, moving with the sway of the sea, and syncing up with the power of a wave. It is quite
        difficult to put in to words what surfing is all about to those who have not experienced it, but I would
        encourage those who haven't to get out there and try it! As the Costa Ricans say <q lang="es">Pura Vida.</q>

        Adventure racing is a horse of another color when compared to something as mellow in nature as surfing. The
        above photo is actually of a friend of mine and I during one of these races. For a lack of a better word,
        the best description for this sport is <strong>intense</strong>. The nature of these events is to throw as many
        challenging obstacles at you as possible while you are traversing miles of uphill terrain. To finish one of
        these races takes quite a bit in the way of training, but it is a great way to motivate yourself to stay in
        shape!

            My father has been playing pool since long before I was born, so as I grew up he taught me a little of the game.
            Using the phrase <i>the game</i> is a little misleading. I actually enjoy playing quite a few games on a pool
            table, though I typically stick to either 9-ball or 8-ball. Pool, or billiards, is what my dad and I bonded
            over once I was old enough to play. This is a hobby that I have extended to my close group of friends and
            tried to teach them the basics as I know them which are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get a good solid tripod stance</li>
            <li>Get as low as possible on the ball over the stick</li>
            <li>All movement should be from the elbow down</li>
            <li>Hit the center of the ball with a followed-through stroke</li>
        </ul>
